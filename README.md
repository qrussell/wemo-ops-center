## ⚠️ "Windows protected your PC" Warning
When you launch `wemo_ops.exe` for the first time, you may see a blue warning from Microsoft Defender SmartScreen.

**This is normal.** Because this is a free, open-source tool created by an independent developer, it does not have a paid digital signature (which costs hundreds of dollars a year).

**To run the app:**
1. Click **More info**.
2. Click **Run anyway**.

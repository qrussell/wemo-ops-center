**Resurrect Your Hardware: The Wemo Cloud is dead, but your devices don't have to be.**
## 📥 Download & Run

No Python installation required.

1.  **Download:** Go to the [Releases Page](../../releases) and download `WemoOps_v3.0.exe`.
2.  **Provisioner** Follow the on-screen instructions to scan for and configure your Wemo devices.
3.  **Dashboard** Scan Network, Control Devices, and Rename Devices.  IP, MAC, FW ver, SN, and HomeKit code are displayed.

## ⚠️ "Windows protected your PC" Warning
When you launch `wemo_ops.exe` for the first time, you may see a blue warning from Microsoft Defender SmartScreen.

**This is normal.** Because this is a free, open-source tool created by an independent developer, it does not have a paid digital signature (which costs hundreds of dollars a year).

**To run the app:**
1. Click **More info**.
2. Click **Run anyway**.

# ⚠️ Repository Moved

The WeMo MCP Server has been migrated to its own dedicated repository for better discoverability and to comply with MCP Registry requirements.

## 🔗 New Location

**Repository:** https://github.com/apiarya/wemo-mcp-server

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install wemo-mcp-server
# or
uvx wemo-mcp-server
```

## Why the Move?

1. **MCP Registry Compliance:** Registry requires base repository URLs
2. **Better Discoverability:** Users from registry land directly on MCP documentation
3. **Ecosystem Standards:** Major MCP servers (GitHub, Cloudflare) use dedicated repos
4. **Clearer Separation:** Reduces confusion between desktop app and MCP server releases

## For Users

No action needed! Installation commands remain the same. The PyPI package `wemo-mcp-server` now publishes from the new repository.

**Latest Version:** v1.1.0 available on PyPI
